# hyprland feature wishlist:
# * dwm-style tags
#   - maybe use the hack mentioned here https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/issues/916
# * dwm-style monacle layout
#   - https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/issues/2050
# * hide cursor on key press, such as when typing or when moving between windows
#   (i.e. it should move the cursor but follow_mouse = 1 but not make it visible until I move it myself)
#   - https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/issues/3045
# * ordered named workspaces
#   - https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/issues/665

# ======= DMENU SUBAMP =======
# dmenu scripts
# Doc: https://wiki.hyprland.org/Configuring/Binds/#submaps
# I'm essentially using this as a hack to create keychords.
# See here for how https://github.com/sadiksaifi/dotfiles/tree/main/.config/hypr#application-keybindings
# BE VERY CAREFUL! MESSING THIS UP CAN DISABLE ALL BINDINGS!
# READ THE DOCS FIRST!!
# I'd recommend having a backup compositor or window manager
# that you can switch to if necessary when you're configuring these.
